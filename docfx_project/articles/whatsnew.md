## What's New - Version 3.6.1

* API Toolkits:
  * Support Toolkit:
    * Fixed a breaking change in 3.6.0 that added an extra property to the [modify_case](../sdk/toolkit_html/fccs/modify_case.html), and [modify_subcase](../sdk/toolkit_html/fccs/modify_subcase.html) APIs. The <b>OnlyOpen</b> property was supposed to be added only to the .Net APIs via the UpdateCaseSetup and UpdateSubcaseSetup objects. The COM APIs should not have been changed.
