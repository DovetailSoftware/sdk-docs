## What's New - Version 3.7.0

* API Toolkits:
  * Support Toolkit:
    * Fixed a breaking change in 3.6.0 that added an extra property to the [modify_case](../sdk/toolkit_html/fccs/modify_case.html), [modify_subcase](../sdk/toolkit_html/fccs/modify_subcase.html), and [change_contact](../sdk/toolkit_html/fccs/change_contact.html) APIs. The <b>OnlyOpen</b> property was supposed to be added only to the .Net APIs via the UpdateCaseSetup, UpdateSubcaseSetup, and ChangeCaseContactSetup objects. The COM APIs should not have been changed.
