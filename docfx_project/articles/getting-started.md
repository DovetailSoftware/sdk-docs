# Getting Started with fcSDK

## General

For an accelerated introduction to the First Choice Foundation Library for .NET (**fcSDK**), please follow these steps in sequence:

1. Read the [Overview of the **fcSDK**](overview.md) topic.
1. Read the Developer Walkthroughs for [FCFL.NET](walkthroughs/fcfl-net-objects.md) and the [API Toolkits](/api/index.md).
1. Install the **fcSDK**. See the section titled "[Installation Guide](installation-guide.md)" for information on how to install these applications.
1. Scan the API reference topics as you browse the source for the examples and run them.
1. Create your own sample application using the **fcSDK** samples as a guide and referring frequently to the API Reference.
1. Read how to [Access Data using ClarifyGeneric](fcsdk-data-access.md) for more in-depth information on using FCFL.NET and ClarifyGeneric to manipulate data in your database.

## Uses of the fcSDK

The **fcSDK** can be used for virtually any task you might have that requires that data be read from or written to a supported database.

The **fcSDK** supports a great many environments. You can write web-based ASP.NET applications, Web Services, Windows Forms applications, console applications and almost any other type of application.

The **fcSDK** programs can be written in any .NET CLS-compliant language. The .NET-based languages (C#, VB.NET, Jscript.NET) are the most common, and provide the quickest path to writing **fcSDK** programs. But other languages and environments are possible. Older COM-based languages, as well as older web environments (JScript or VBScript) are also possible using the **fcSDK** [COM Compatibility Layer](compatibility-guide.md).

## About Java™ Support

The **fcSDK** is based on the Microsoft™ .NET Framework environment. As such, it does not natively support Java™ programs and environments.
