## FCFL API Toolkit for ClearLogistics

---

**Overview**

Many customers have wanted the ability to customize the Clarify environment easily by adding base Clarify functions (such as part request creation, closure, modification, or note logging) into web applications.

The **First Choice Software FCFL API Toolkit for Clear Logistics** solves these problems, as well as many others. The toolkit is a set of FCFL functions that you may call from your applications.

All of the APIs perform the same base functions as the Clarify GUI - all database records are properly written, activity logs are generated to track the API call, and time bombs are added to the system so that business rules can be fired based on the API function call.

While all of the APIs mimic the Clarify base function, many of them provide augmented functionality that Clarify customers have requested. For example, the base Clarify yank function always places the object in the user's default WIPBin. With the yank APIs in the toolkit, you have the choice of placing the object in any specific WIPBin for the user, or in the default WIPBin.

The APIs are simple to use. One simple API call is provided for each function, and very few data values must be supplied. The APIs are flexible in that they provide a large number of optional arguments that allow you to customize the API calls as needed.
