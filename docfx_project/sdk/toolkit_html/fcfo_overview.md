## API Toolkit for ClearLogistics Field Operations

**Overview**

Many customers have wanted the ability to customize the Clarify environment easily by adding base Clarify functions (such as log time and expenses, log part used transactions, etc.) into web applications.

The **First Choice Software FCFL API Toolkit for Clear Logistics Field Operations** solves these problems, as well as many others. The toolkit is a set of functions that you may call from your applications.

All of the APIs perform the same base functions as the Clarify GUI - all database records are properly written, activity logs are generated to track the API call, and time bombs are added to the system so that business rules can be fired based on the API function call.

While all of the APIs mimic the Clarify base function, many of them provide augmented functionality that Clarify customers have requested. For example, the base Clarify log_parts_used function always requires the user to update the site configuration and inventory as separate steps (after the part used record is created). With the API, these functions can all be executed at the same time.

The APIs are simple to use. One simple API call is provided for each function, and very few data values must be supplied. The APIs are flexible in that they provide a large number of optional arguments that allow you to customize the API calls as needed.
